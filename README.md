Language used : MATLAB

We used 5 types of road signs : 
    - Added Lane
    - Keep Right
    - Pedestrian Crossing
    - Signal Ahead
    - Stop Sign

Project report is in the file : project_report.pdf

Run the following files in order:

1. computeDictionary.m
2. batchToVisualWords.m
3. buildRecognitionSystem.m
4. evaluateRecognitionSystem.m 

This will result in dictionary.mat, wordMap.mat for each image file, vision.mat and a confusion matrix respectively.

Final Accuracy : 91.2%
