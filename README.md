In order to run our code, download it from the public google drive and open the project in MATLAB.

Run the following files in order:

1. computeDictionary.m
2. batchToVisualWords.m
3. buildRecognitionSystem.m
4. evaluateRecognitionSystem.m 

This will result in dictionary.mat, wordMap.mat for each image file, vision.mat and a confusion matrix respectively.
